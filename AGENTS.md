## Core principle: dependencies change only on explicit instruction

**Dependencies may only be changed by explicit instruction from the
maintainer.** This covers every dependency this repository declares, in
every runtime and every manifest:

- `package.json` `dependencies`, `peerDependencies` and `devDependencies`,
  and their lockfiles;
- `go.mod` `require` and `replace` lines, their versions, and `go.sum`;
- `Cargo.toml` dependency tables and `Cargo.lock`;
- any other manifest here, nested test modules included.

Adding, removing, re-pointing or re-versioning any of them is a
dependency change.

- **A dependency never arrives as a side effect.** Watch for an import,
  `go mod tidy`, `npm install`, `cargo update`, a stamped template, or a
  fix for something else. If a change would alter a dependency, stop and
  ask before making it. Do not make it and explain afterwards.
- **An explicit instruction names the change**, for example "bump the
  parser requirement in X to 0.12" or "cascade the parser release". A
  goal is not an instruction for its means. "Make CI green", "ship the C
  library" or "fix the build" does not authorise a dependency change,
  however direct the route through one looks.
- **This repository's own version sites are not dependencies.** They
  include the root entry of its own lockfile. A release bump moves them.
- **Versions track the latest release.** Every dependency is kept at
  its latest published version, and none is held on an older one. That
  is the maintainer's standing instruction, so moving a dependency to
  its latest version needs no further one. Holding a dependency back,
  or adding, removing or re-pointing one, still does.

## Core principle: transient tasks report progress

**Every transient task produces status output at least every 30 seconds,
with an estimate of how far through it is, as a percentage, where one can
be made.** This is the maintainer's instruction. A transient task is any
work that runs for a while and then ends: a build, a test or conformance
sweep, an install or a fetch, a release, a wait on CI, a benchmark, a
script or loop you write, and anything sent to the background.

- **Minimal is enough.** One line with the step and a count, such as
  `conformance: 412 of 1500 (27%)`, meets it. When no total is known, print
  what is known (the step, the current item, the elapsed time) and say the
  percentage is unknown rather than inventing one.
- **Build it into what you write.** A script or loop prints a line per
  item or per interval. A quiet tool gets its progress or verbose flag, or
  a wrapper that prints a heartbeat, so that nothing runs silent for more
  than 30 seconds.
- **Silence reads as a hang.** Whoever is watching, a person or an agent,
  cannot tell a slow task from a stuck one without it, and so cannot
  decide whether to wait or to stop it.

A quick command that finishes within 30 seconds needs nothing extra.

## Pull requests

Open pull requests **ready for review, never as drafts.** This is a
standing maintainer preference, and it overrides any tooling or agent
default that opens pull requests in draft state.

## What this project is

The `alchemy` command, in TypeScript, Go and Rust: `canon`, `format`,
`check`, `explain` and `run`, as alchemy's
[`docs/language.md`](https://github.com/tabnas/alchemy/blob/main/docs/language.md)
describes them, and `translate` and `formats`, which write a document of
any tabnas format with translation parts in any other, composed by
alchemy's `translate` from the parts each format's package exports
(admin ADR-27; the README has the options). It is the composition root
of three components that do not depend on each other's implementations:

- **alchemy** holds the language and the shared types: the event
  protocol (events, sinks, tables, `Fail` and its codes, limits,
  selectors, datums) and the `Routers` and `Renderers` interfaces a
  compiled program is lowered through.
- **transduce** depends on alchemy's shared types and implements
  `Routers`; its parser source reads the input document.
- **render** depends on alchemy's shared types and implements
  `Renderers`; its writers put the text on standard output.

The command builds a transduce `Routers` and a render `Renderers`,
passes both to alchemy's `compile`, and runs the result over the input.
Nothing else in the fleet constructs all three, so behaviour that needs
all three belongs here, and a library that needs one of them depends on
that one alone.

## Layout

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `ts/` | `@tabnas/alchemy-cli`: the `alchemy` bin and its tests, and the tests of alchemy's programs (`ts/test/host.ts` composes the three components for them) |
| `go/` | `github.com/tabnas/alchemy-cli/go`: the `alchemy` command and its tests |
| `go/e2e/` | the tests of alchemy's programs in Go: test files only, alchemy's exported API composed with transduce and render |
| `rs/` | `tabnas-alchemy-cli`: the `alchemy` binary and its tests, and the tests of alchemy's programs (`rs/tests/common/` composes the three) |
| `ci/rust/run.sh` | the Rust gate `.github/workflows/rust.yml` runs |
| `ci/polyglot/run.sh` | the TypeScript and Go gate the same workflow runs |
| `ci/phase.sh` | `phase`, which both gates run each step through: a line every 25 seconds while it runs |

## The tests of alchemy's programs

alchemy depends on neither transduce nor render (the maintainer's ruling
of 2026-10-08), so its releases and theirs never leave a requirement a
release behind. Its tests that run programs need all three, so they are
here, in every runtime:
- `run.tsv`, natively and interpreted;
- the catalogue test over every error row of alchemy's four fixture files;
- the lowering;
- events;
- linked sources;
- the translation parts;
- the standard library's differential test.

They read alchemy's `test/spec/` and transduce's `rs/tests/` from the
sibling checkouts, and fail, naming the path, when either is missing.
alchemy's `.github/workflows/downstream.yml` runs this repository's two
gates against each change there, so a change to alchemy meets them before
it merges. A behaviour of alchemy's that a row can express is pinned in
alchemy's `test/spec/`, not here.

## The translation matrix

`translate`'s tests (`rs/tests/translate_test.rs`,
`ts/test/translate.test.ts`, `go/translate/translate_test.go`) run the
cross product of their corpus into every format: transduce's fixtures and
JSONTestSuite's documents in every runtime, the grammar notations'
example grammars in TypeScript's and Go's run and in Rust's release run,
and every format's own `test/spec/*.tsv` in Rust's release run
(`ci/rust/run.sh`), ABNF's grammars among them. A pair is held to what
its target declares: written, and read back under the target's
conventions (its loss list); or refused with the code and the reason its
parts declare, which the matrix counts: a schema-only target (one that
writes a schema's tree with no embedding into it: C, CSS, PGN, proto and
the grammar notations) refuses another format's tree, a grammar
notation's render refuses a grammar spec it has no form for, naming what
it met, and Semantic Versioning's embedding refuses a tree that is not a
version. A pair refused otherwise, or written where a refusal is
declared, fails. A document is left out as a source where it is past
what every format takes: nested deeper than 100 levels, or holding more
values than the run's size bound (10,000 by default, which leaves out the
larger GBNF examples and RFC 3986's URI grammar, whose spec holds 513,409;
100,000 in Rust's release run); each run pins how many it leaves out.

The grammar notations, ABNF, EBNF and GBNF, share the schema
`grammar-spec`, the grammar spec their compilers emit, so each writes the
others' documents. A grammar spec written in a notation is held to the
round trip each render declares: from the same notation it reads back as
it was, or, where the loss list says it compiles back to another (a spec
whose alternatives the compiler reordered, a left recursion through
another rule), as one the render writes again as the same text; from
another notation, which compiles back under the target's own settings
and recognises what it recognised, as a spec the render writes again as
text that reads back as that spec. And every grammar written is held to
what it recognises: the spec read and the spec the written text compiles
to, each installed on an engine of its own, parse each of the document's
samples alike. The samples are the inputs the notations' repositories'
own tests give their example grammars, accepted and refused alike
(`test/notation-samples.json`, which all three runtimes read), and, in
Rust's release run, the inputs ABNF's fixture rows give each grammar.
The one difference the loss lists declare is the lexing: a spec of
another notation compiles back under the target's settings, so across
GBNF's exact lexing and the others' default one, which skips white
space, a sample holding white space may be recognised otherwise. Such a
pair is registered, never passed: the same file's `otherwise` names
each pair with exactly the samples it recognises otherwise, every cross
product holds each pair it compares to that list, and Rust's release
run, which compares every pair named, holds every entry to a pair it
compares. A grammar recognising any other sample otherwise fails, unless
its pair is registered with its package's defect (`DEFECTIVE_PAIRS`).

A format is read with its package's parser, through transduce's parser
source, unless the parser's own value is not yet the tree its parts
declare and the package's API reads a document as that tree: then that
tree is the document, read whole (`Reader::Tree` in Rust, `tree` in Go,
`{ tree }` in TypeScript), with the checks the package's API makes first:
- expressions, as the simplified tree (`parse_simplified`,
  `parseSimplified`, `SimplifyOrdered`);
- proto's descriptor, as its parse builds it, which first refuses a
  document nesting past proto's cap, before the engine builds a tree whose
  drop could abort the process (`parse_value`, `parse`, `ParseValue`);
- C, as the realized tree in Rust (`tabnas_c::parse`); TypeScript and Go
  walk the parser's value;
- the grammar notations, as the pure-data grammar spec each package's
  compiler writes for a host, recognition off, as strict JSON, read as
  JSON (`abnf_compile` and its twins for ABNF; for EBNF and GBNF the
  shared compiler's serializers over the conversion with the builtins on,
  which tabnas-abnf re-exports);
- Go's feeds and PGN databases, whose modules build typed values, through
  their JSON encoding (`plainTree`).

Where a package's own parse checks a document before its parser runs, and
the parser does not check it itself, the reader makes the same check
first (`Reader::Checked` in Rust, `check` in Go, `{ parser, check }` in
TypeScript): json5 refuses a document holding no value with its own codes
in every runtime.

A format whose reader, as this command reads a document through
transduce, does not build the tree its parts declare is registered in
that runtime's test with its defect (`READER_DEFECTS`, `readerDefects`):
its documents are left out as sources and counted, and a test holds each
entry to an example, comparing what the command reads with what the
format's package builds with its own API (for a version past 2^53 - 1,
its own round trip), so an entry fails once the reader is repaired, and
is then deleted. Go also pins the order a reader's objects are written
in where it is not the Rust and TypeScript readers' (`orderDivergent`:
plain maps in sorted key order, typed values in their fields' order, and
the grammar spec tabnas-bnf's Go serializer writes in name order, its
match tokens' order in a list of its own), which the matrix, comparing
values, cannot see. That spec has lost the order of its rules, which
ranks its tokens, so each notation's render refuses one that Go reads
with two match tokens or more, as its loss list declares, and writes the
others with their rules in name order; a Go test pins it, and fails once
the serializer keeps the order. A defect is the package's to repair;
never register one to make a pair pass without naming it, and never work
around one here in silence.

## Build and test

The Rust crate builds against sibling checkouts of alchemy, transduce,
render and the grammars they use, cloned next to this repository:
`rs/Cargo.toml` takes them by path, and `ci/rust/run.sh` lists every one
the graph needs. They are all on crates.io, but the committed manifest
stays path-only. TypeScript and Go install the published packages
instead: `npm install` takes the `@tabnas/*` devDependencies from the npm
registry, and `go/go.mod` requires released versions from the module
proxy. For those two, sibling checkouts are optional as code:
`ci/polyglot/run.sh` links them over the registry copies, and admin's
`scripts/link.sh` does the same locally. They are not optional as
fixtures: the tests of alchemy's programs read `../alchemy` and
`../transduce`, as above. The CI workflows name the list.

- TypeScript, from `ts/`: `npm install`, then `npm test`.
- Go, from `go/`: `gofmt -l .`, `go vet ./...`, `go test ./...`, with a
  `go.work` outside the repositories when the siblings carry unreleased
  changes.
- Rust: `ci/rust/run.sh`, which runs `cargo fmt --check`, the build, the
  tests and clippy, then compares `rs/Cargo.lock` with what it was before:
  the gate fails if cargo rewrote anything but the versions of the sibling
  crates, which move with the checkouts. That comparison is why the gate
  does not pass `--locked`, as alchemy's, transduce's and render's gates
  do not.
- TypeScript and Go together: `ci/polyglot/run.sh`, which builds the
  TypeScript siblings in order and runs this package's suite, then the Go
  suite plain and with `-tags tabnas_nodecell`, and vet.

## Releasing

`.tabnas-kind` says `TOOL`, so the release workflows publish (admin
ADR-20). A release is two steps, and a session's credentials cannot push
tags, so neither step pushes one:

1. **A reviewed bump PR** that moves every version site together:
   `ts/package.json`, `VERSION` in `ts/src/cli.ts` and in
   `go/cmd/alchemy/main.go`, and `version` in `rs/Cargo.toml` with the
   root `tabnas-alchemy-cli` entry of `rs/Cargo.lock` (the binary's
   `VERSION` reads it). `ts/test/version.test.ts`,
   `go/cmd/alchemy/version_test.go` and `rs/tests/version_test.rs` fail
   when they disagree.
2. **Dispatch `release.yml` on `main`** with `go` true, once `main` CI is
   green on the bump commit. It publishes npm over OIDC, writes the
   `ts/v` and `go/v` tags, makes the GitHub Release on the `go/v` tag, and
   publishes the crate through `crates-release.yml`. Both trusted
   publishers name `release.yml`.

alchemy, transduce and render are released before this package (admin
`publish.sh` ORDER), since the build resolves them from the registry.
