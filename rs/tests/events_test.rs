// `events`: the source's events as items a program reads one by one, and
// the operators a renderer over them needs (`push`, `pop`, `top`, `count`,
// `quoted`, `repeat`). The proof is a renderer of arbitrary nesting, which
// nothing before `events` could express: a tiny YAML-like block form
// written by a `scan-emit` whose state is the stack of open containers,
// one keyword marker each, asserted byte for byte; then the plan report.
// Moved here from tabnas-alchemy's tests, since each runs on transduce's
// routers and render's renderers; the affine rule over `events`, which
// only compiles, stays in alchemy's events_test.rs.
