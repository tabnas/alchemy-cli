//! The cross product `alchemy translate` answers for: every document of
//! the corpora, read with its format's grammar, written in every format
//! the command carries, read back with that format's grammar, and compared
//! with the document's own value under the target's declared conventions
//! (its loss list). A pair that fails to write, that writes a document its
//! own grammar refuses, or that reads back as anything but the conventions
//! say is a failure, and so is a corpus that shrinks.
//!
//! A pair whose target declares that it refuses the document is held to
//! that refusal, its code and the start of its message, and counted: a
//! schema-only target (one that writes a schema's tree with no embedding
//! into it: C, CSS, PGN, proto and the grammar notations ABNF, EBNF and
//! GBNF) refuses another format's tree, a grammar notation refuses a
//! grammar spec it has no form for, naming what it met, and Semantic
//! Versioning's embedding refuses a tree that is not a version. A refusal
//! of another kind, or a document written where a refusal is declared, is
//! a failure. The grammar notations share a schema, the grammar spec their
//! compilers emit, so each writes the others' documents.
//!
//! The corpora are the sibling checkouts': transduce's fixtures (aless's: a
//! document of every format but C, CSS, expressions, PGN, proto, Semantic
//! Versioning and the grammar notations, whose own fixtures the release
//! run reads, and more for YAML and ZON), the documents of JSONTestSuite
//! every JSON parser must accept (jsonc's conformance pins), and the
//! example grammars of the grammar notations' repositories. A fixture its
//! own grammar refuses (ZON's repeated fields) is no document, and is
//! counted as one refused; so is a document of a format whose reader is a
//! registered defect (`READER_DEFECTS`), counted apart.
