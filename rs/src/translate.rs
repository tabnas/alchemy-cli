//! `alchemy translate`: a document in one of the formats whose grammar
//! packages this command carries, written in any of them.
//!
//! Every format's package exports its translation parts: its manifest's
//! `translate` object (the shapes it reads and writes, the root its render
//! needs, the schema its events carry), its render, and, where it has
//! them, its lift and its embedding, each an alchemy file. This module
//! reads them into alchemy's [`Part`]s, has alchemy's `translate` module
//! compose the route (the source's lift, the root adapters, the
//! embedding, the inferred table, the render), compiles the composition
//! with transduce's routers and render's renderers, and runs it over the
//! input read with the source format's grammar. A package that ships a
//! transducer part (its manifest's `translate.transduce`, the alchemy file
//! whose entry makes the format's JSON events of the parser's rule passes)
//! is read through it: the route is composed over the transducer
//! (`compose_parsed`), and the input's rule passes stream through
//! transduce's `ParserEventSource` into the program, whatever the grammar,
//! with nothing held but what the part keeps, and the engine's arrays
//! emptied behind the stream where transduce verifies the grammar alike
//! pruned and not ([`Format::pruned`]). Any other format is parsed
//! whole and its value walked, and so is a document when a path selects a
//! value below the root, and one whose events are not what the grammar's
//! value holds, which the part refuses part way (a YAML stream of several
//! documents, a merge key, a repeated member, which a part streams twice
//! and `tree-contract` refuses): the grammar's own value is the document,
//! so it is read again whole. Where a package's parser builds a value that
//! is not yet the tree its parts declare, and the package's API reads a
//! document as that tree (expr's simplified form, proto's descriptor, C's
//! realized syntax tree, and the grammar spec a grammar notation's
//! document compiles to), that tree is the document, read whole. Nothing
//! here knows a format by its name: a format is what its manifest says,
//! and a package whose manifest names no parts this host can take is not
//! a format here.
//!
//! A document may be a file ([`Document::File`]): the transducer part's
//! route reads it through a reader (transduce's
//! `ParserEventSource::from_reader`), a window of it at a time where the
//! source's grammar declares `lex.window` (tabnas/parser's admin ADR-30),
//! and every other route reads it whole.
