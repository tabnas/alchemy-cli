// `dmog translate`: a document in one of the formats whose grammar
// packages this command carries, written in any of them (the Rust crate's
// rs/src/translate.rs).
//
// Every format's package exports its translation parts: its manifest's
// `translate` object (the shapes it reads and writes, the root its render
// needs, the schema its events carry), its render, and, where it has them,
// its lift and its embedding, each an alchemy file. This module reads them
// into alchemy's `Part`s, has alchemy's `translate` namespace compose the
// route (the source's lift, the root adapters, the embedding, the inferred
// table, the render), compiles the composition with transduce's routers
// and render's renderers, and runs it over the input read with the source
// format's grammar. A package that ships a transducer part (its manifest's
// `translate.transduce`, the alchemy file whose entry makes the format's
// JSON events of the parser's rule passes) is read through it: the route
// is composed over the transducer (`composeParsed`), and the input's rule
// passes stream through transduce's `ParserEventSource` into the program,
// whatever the grammar, with nothing held but what the part keeps. Any
// other format is parsed whole and its value walked, and so is a document
// when a path selects a value below the root, and one whose events are not
// what the grammar's value holds, which the part refuses part way (a YAML
// stream of several documents, a merge key, a repeated member, which a
// part streams twice and `tree-contract` refuses): the grammar's own value
// is the document, so it is read again whole. Where a package's parser
// builds a value that is not yet the tree its parts declare, and the
// package's API reads a document as that tree (expr's simplified form,
// proto's descriptor, and the grammar spec a grammar notation's document
// compiles to), that tree is the document, read whole. Nothing here knows
// a format by its name: a format is what its manifest says, and a package
// whose manifest names no parts this host can take is not a format here.
