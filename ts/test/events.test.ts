// `events` (rs/tests/events_test.rs): the source's events as items a
// program reads one by one, and the operators a renderer over them needs
// (`push`, `pop`, `top`, `count`, `quoted`, `repeat`). The proof is a
// renderer of arbitrary nesting, which nothing before `events` could
// express: a tiny YAML-like block form written by a `scan-emit` whose state
// is the stack of open containers, one keyword marker each, asserted byte
// for byte; then the affine rule over `events`, and the plan report.
//
// Moved from alchemy's ts/test/events.test.ts, which keeps the affine rule
// (checked without running anything): these run their programs on
// transduce's routers and render's renderers, which alchemy does not
// depend on.
