package translate_test

// translate_test.go: the cross product `alchemy translate` answers for
// (rs/tests/translate_test.rs): every document of the corpora, read with
// its format's grammar, written in every format the command carries, read
// back with that format's grammar, and compared with the document's own
// value under the target's declared conventions (its loss list). A pair
// that fails to write, that writes a document its own grammar refuses, or
// that reads back as anything but the conventions say is a failure, and so
// is a corpus that shrinks.
//
// A pair whose target declares that it refuses the document is held to
// that refusal, its code and the start of its message, and counted: a
// schema-only target (one that writes a schema's tree with no embedding
// into it: C, CSS, PGN, proto and the grammar notations ABNF, EBNF and
// GBNF) refuses another format's tree, a grammar notation refuses a
// grammar spec it has no form for, naming what it met, and Semantic
// Versioning's embedding refuses a tree that is not a version. A refusal of
// another kind, or a document written where a refusal is declared, is a
// failure. The grammar notations share a schema, the grammar spec their
// compilers emit, so each writes the others' documents.
//
// The corpora are the sibling checkouts': transduce's fixtures (aless's: a
// document of every format but C, CSS, expressions, PGN, proto, Semantic
// Versioning and the grammar notations, and more for YAML and ZON), the
// documents of JSONTestSuite every JSON parser must accept (jsonc's
// conformance pins), and the example grammars of the grammar notations'
// repositories, which the Rust suite reads in its release run. A fixture
// its own grammar refuses is no document, and is counted as one refused;
// so is a document of a format whose reader is a registered defect
// (readerDefects), counted apart. The Rust suite's cross product of every
// format's own fixture corpus, which it runs in release, stays Rust's.
