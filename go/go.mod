// render's renderers), and the JSON grammar `run` reads its document with.
// The shared types, and the Routers and Renderers that transduce and
// render build on them, are in all three from v0.2.0.

// What alchemy's end-to-end tests (e2e) read documents with and run
// fixtures through: the engine, the grammars and the shared fixture
// runner. They were alchemy's own tests, which ran programs on transduce
// and render; alchemy depends on neither, so they are here.
