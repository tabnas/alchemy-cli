// document with, and the twelve `translate` reads and writes, each with
// its translation parts. The shared types, and the Routers and Renderers
// that transduce and render build on them, are in all three from v0.2.0.

// documents with the grammars above and run fixtures: the engine and the
// shared fixture runner. They were alchemy's own tests, which ran programs
// on transduce and render; alchemy depends on neither, so they are here.
// translate imports the engine too, to read ZON's big integers in the form
// ZON's translation part declares (zonParser).
